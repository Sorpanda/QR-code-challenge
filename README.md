# QR-code-challenge
A challenge from the Front-end Mentor website. My first challenge, super newbie here.

I used HTML and CSS. 
I centered the whole thing with Flexbox, I don't know if that was the right way to go though?
The readme file of the challenge gave the width for mobile and desktop. 
But I didn't use that in my code, how should I use this? 
When checking in inspector mode in chrome on the exact width of the mobile version it already looked exactly as it should be without having to do anything in CSS to scale it, is this because of flexbox?

Here are the screenshots.
